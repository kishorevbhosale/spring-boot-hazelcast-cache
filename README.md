# Caching-With-Spring-Boot-Using-HazelCast

### What is caching ?
In computing, a cache is a high-speed data storage layer which stores a subset of data, typically transient in nature, so that future requests for that data are served up faster than is possible by accessing the dataâ€™s primary storage location. Caching allows you to efficiently reuse previously retrieved or computed data.

### What is Hazelcast?
Hazelcast is a distributed In-Memory Data Grid platform for Java. The architecture supports high scalability and data distribution in a clustered environment. It supports the auto-discovery of nodes and intelligent synchronization. Likewise, Hazelcast offers various features such as Distributed Data Structure, Distributed Compute, Distributed Query, etc.
